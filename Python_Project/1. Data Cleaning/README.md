## 🧺 Smart Data Laundry
Smart Data Laundry is a Python-based automated data cleaning pipeline designed to streamline the most time-consuming stage of data analysis: preprocessing. It transforms raw .csv and .xlsx datasets into structured, analysis-ready data by automatically handling common issues such as missing values, duplicate records, inconsistent formatting, and incorrect data types. By applying a standardized and reproducible workflow, this project demonstrates practical data cleaning skills, automation capability, and strong ETL thinking essential for real-world Data Analyst roles.
