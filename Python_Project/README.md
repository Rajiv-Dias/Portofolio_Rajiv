# Airbnb Data Analysis (Python)

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, exploring, and analyzing Airbnb open data to understand listing distribution and pricing patterns across neighbourhoods.  
The analysis is intended to demonstrate fundamental data analysis skills using Python.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Data
- Source: Airbnb Open Data (public dataset)
- Description: The dataset contains information about Airbnb listings, including price, neighbourhood group, room type, and availability.

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing:
  - Handling missing values
  - Removing duplicate records
  - Standardizing column formats
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Understanding data structure
  - Analyzing price distribution
  - Examining listing distribution by neighbourhood group
- Data visualization to support insights

## Key Insights
- The distribution of Airbnb listings across neighbourhood groups is uneven, with certain areas having a significantly higher concentration of listings. This indicates higher market competition and stronger demand concentration in specific regions.
- Visualization results show no strong linear relationship between minimum nights and listing prices. High-priced listings appear across various minimum stay requirements, suggesting that pricing is more influenced by factors such as location, room type, and amenities rather than minimum nights.
- Price distributions vary across neighbourhood groups, where some areas exhibit higher median prices and wider price ranges. This reflects differences in market demand and listing characteristics among regions.
- There is no strong correlation between listing prices and the number of reviews. Higher prices do not necessarily correspond to higher booking volume, indicating that listing popularity is influenced by factors beyond price alone.
